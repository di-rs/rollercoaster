Fix filter mode UX: arrow navigation, enter-to-execute, and accent color

- Arrow keys (↑/↓) now work while the filter is active
- Enter in filter mode executes the highlighted task directly instead of just closing the filter
- Added steel blue accent color (#4A86C8) for header, filter bar, selected item, and status bar
